# Learn to Code by Solving Problems - No Starch Press

This repo contains my solutions to the problems presented in the book "Learn to Code by Solving Problems" printed on No Starch Press. 

If you happen to be reading the solutions and wonder why the prompt for `input()` doesn't contain any prompt text, it's because the tests at DMOJ will fail if you output anything other than the answer 🤷🏻‍♂️
